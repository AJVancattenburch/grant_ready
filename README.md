# Grant Ready

## About
Grants can be a reliable source of funding and sustainability for a nonprofit. However, there are many considerations that must be taken into account before approaching a funder or writing a grant.

With over 10 years of experience in full-service grant-writing from both public and private sources and over $10 million in successfully secured funds, Grant Ready comes alongside organizations at any stage of the process to enhance their competitiveness for grant funding.
